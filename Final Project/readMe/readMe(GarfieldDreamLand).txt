Read Me (Dream Land Game)

Purpose of this game:
This game was created for my CIT 190 Final Project, fun for children.

Directions for play:
Use the arrow keys to navigate Garfield through the noodles, he's too 
full! Try and beat your high score.

Current problems and how to solve them:
No current issues with the game at the moment. 

Future thoughts:
Make it so when Garfield eats a noodle, he'll grow bigger eat time until 
he's full! Try to eat as many noodles as possible in a time frame.
