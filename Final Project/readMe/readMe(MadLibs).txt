Read Me (Mad Libs)

Purpose of this game:
This game was created for fun, to create funny stories.

Directions for play:
Drag and drop the elements according to noun, adjective, 
verb, etc. Make the story and then read it after it is 
complete!

Current problems and how to solve them:
My current issue is getting the list of draggables in 2 rows, 
instead of one long line. I'm hoping to maybe use columns and 
hope that solves the problem.

Future thoughts:
Get multiple different mad libs attached with different themes.
