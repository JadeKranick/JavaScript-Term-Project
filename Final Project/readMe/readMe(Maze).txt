Read Me (Maze Game)

Purpose of this game:
This game was created for my CIT 190 Final Project, 
fun for children.

Directions for play:
Click and drag each character on the left side through 
the maze to the other side to reach Jon Arbuckle!

Current problems and how to solve them:
No current issues with the game at the moment.

Future thoughts:
I would like to add a maze using canvas and make it
so that you would actually hit a wall.
