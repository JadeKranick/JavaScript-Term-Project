# JavaScript-Term-Project
This project was created as a final project for my CIT 190 HTML and JavaScript course. 
It consists of 3 different games that are run through HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery, and Canvas.

This project can be useful for those who are looking to build games from HTML5 and Canvas, as well as
exploring JavaScript and JQuery for educational purposes. Pure entertainment to play the games as well
with your children!

This project is maintained by me, Jade Kranick, and I am the only contributor.
